Breaking Bad...

2
00:00:03,126 --> 00:00:05,140
I knew there would be
a drop in quality,

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,350
but, 68%?

4
00:00:08,497 --> 00:00:10,724
I left a viable operation,

5
00:00:10,877 --> 00:00:12,651
the rest was up to you.

6
00:00:14,503 --> 00:00:16,175
All along it was you!

7
00:00:16,314 --> 00:00:18,198
Hank, my cancer is back.

8
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:22,222
In six months you won't have
someone to prosecute.

9
00:00:23,145 --> 00:00:24,654
Here. Take it.

11
00:04:49,692 --> 00:04:50,876
Mariano, it's me.

12
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:53,125
I need you to get Skyler
on the line.

13
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:57,466
No, no, I need you to get
her on the phone right now.

14
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,717
Tell her it's urgent.

15
00:05:01,888 --> 00:05:04,723
No-- What do you mean
she won't get off the phone?

16
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I am giving you permission,
Mariano.

17
00:05:07,177 --> 00:05:08,927
You make her get off the phone.

18
00:05:15,885 --> 00:05:17,219
Mariano,

19
00:05:17,237 --> 00:05:19,688
who is Skyler
on the phone with?

20
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,452
Yeah.

21
00:05:36,372 --> 00:05:38,345
Okay.

22
00:05:54,524 --> 00:05:56,391
Where is she?
Where's Skyler?

23
00:05:56,425 --> 00:05:57,759
She just kinda left.

24
00:05:57,777 --> 00:06:00,195
She didn't say
where she was going.

25
00:06:53,633 --> 00:06:56,767
Skyler, my--
my head is spinning.
